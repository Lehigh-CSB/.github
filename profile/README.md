## Welcome to the CSBA's Github!

Lehigh University's Computer Science and Business Association is a student organization run by and for students majoring in Computer Science and Business. As an organization, we promote the cohort's wants and needs to the Computer Science Department, the College of Business, and the greater university. In regards to students we have three main goals: building technical skills, assisting in the job application process, and encouraging a fun social atmosphere. Some of our events are open to all students at Lehigh regardless of major. Please reach out if you have any inquiries.

### Important Resources

We want to promote the use of GitHub among students, so there are several important resources for students on this GitHub. 

[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Lehigh-CSB/discussions) will be the place where students can ask questions to everyone in CSB. Questions about registration, grading rationale, or really anything CSB related can be asked there. Prospective students can also ask questions if they would like to get to know more about the program.

[GitHub projects](https://github.com/orgs/Lehigh-CSB/projects?type=beta) is GitHub's version of a Kanban board. We will use this to update everyone on what the Executive Board is working on. There also may be additional boards in the future for specific programs, projects, and events.
