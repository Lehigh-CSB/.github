## Welcome to the CSBA's Github!

The Computer Science and Business Association is here to support you, Computer Science and Business majors. We want to promote your wants and needs to the Computer Science Department, the College of Business, and the greater university. We also want to better your preparedness and experience, so we will focus on building technical skills, assisting in the job application process, and encouraging a fun social atmosphere. Questions can be asked publicly on the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Lehigh-CSB/discussions) or privately through [email](mailto:incsba@lehigh.edu) (you can also email specific [E-Board](#the-executive-board) members too

### Important Resources

We want to promote the use of GitHub among students, so there are several important resources for students on this GitHub. 

[Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=aW5jc2JhQGxlaGlnaC5lZHU) is where we share CSBA hosted, co-sposnored, or CSB-relevant events. Location, time changes, flyers, and more are attached to this so we reccomend you sign-up.

[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/Lehigh-CSB/Computer-Science-and-Business-Association/wiki) is where you can find professional development and technical resources, information about the organization and more!

[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Lehigh-CSB/discussions) will be the place where students can ask questions to everyone in CSB. Questions about registration, grading rationale, or really anything CSB related can be asked there. Prospective students can also ask questions if they would like to get to know more about the program.

[GitHub projects](https://github.com/orgs/Lehigh-CSB/projects?type=beta) is GitHub's version of a Kanban board. We will use this to update everyone on what the Executive Board is working on. There also may be additional boards in the future for specific programs, projects, and events.

[GroupMe](https://groupme.com/join_group/35276853/t4yllUCs) is often used by students to promote events or useful information to everyone. It is a more informal and quick way to message the whole group of CSB students.

[LINC](https://lehigh.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/csba) - Lehigh Involvement Connection is Lehigh University Office of Student Engagements official club listing. You can join through here, we might use it more later but the interface is not team-friendly.

#### What does the Executive Board do?

The members of the board head initiatives in their position's field to contribute to the mission of the association. We meet on a weekly basis to plan and discuss and anyone is welcome to show up and voice their opinion. We keep meeting minutes which can be found attatched to the corresponding meeting event in the GCal or under the Shared GDrive `CSBA > #Admin > Agendas`.
